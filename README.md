# employee-info-tracker

This app is designed for a project manager who wants an easy way to organize their team's information.  Upon running node index.js, the user is prompted with multiple questions about his or her self, then asked if they want to add an engineer, an intern, or if they are done.  Each of these options prompt the user with different options.  When the user selects "done," the information is taken and an html page is created with the information on it.
